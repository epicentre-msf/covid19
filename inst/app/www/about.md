## About

---

The goal of this dashboard is to provide an epidemiological overview of the COVID-19 pandemic, incorporating data from multiple sources. 

It is being actively developed by the data science team at [Epicentre MSF](https://epicentre.msf.org/en).

The tool is built using the R programming language and the shiny web framework. Packages used include the tidyverse, leaflet and highcharter.

If you are part of the MSF network, you can access further Epicentre COVID-19 content on our [Sharepoint site](https://msfintl.sharepoint.com/sites/grp-epi-proj-ncov).
