\title{Split dataset into a list of time-series, one for each country (splitting uses the iso_a3 variable)
Filter the time-series to a time-frame defined by time_unit_extent
Fill the gaps in the time-series, assuming that at missing date, cases and deaths = 0 
Smoothing using moving average with a parameterable time-window (in days)
Model time-series using a linear regression}
